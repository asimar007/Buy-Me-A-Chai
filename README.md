# Chai Buying DApp

üçµ My project reimagines support for creators through Web3 technology. Unlike Buy Me a Chai, it's decentralized, transparent, and inclusive. Creators showcase their work, supporters donate cryptocurrency directly via Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring transparency and global accessibility. With community governance and smart contract automation, it's a platform where creativity flourishes, and contributions matter. ‚òïÔ∏è

## Important Notes for Running the Project

### 1. Install MetaMask Extension

- MetaMask is a digital wallet and a gateway to blockchain apps. To interact with our project, you need to install the MetaMask extension in your browser.
- Download MetaMask: [MetaMask Extension](https://metamask.io/download/)

### 2. Select Test Network (Select Sepolia)

- After installing MetaMask, make sure to select the Sepolia test network. This is crucial for testing the project's functionality without using real cryptocurrency.
- Follow these steps to switch to the Sepolia test network:
  1.  Click on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser.
  2.  Select the network dropdown (usually set to Mainnet by default).
  3.  Choose 'Sepolia Test Network' from the list of available networks.

### 3. Add Some Fake Ether

- To perform transactions and interact with the project on the Sepolia test network, you'll need some fake Ether (testnet Ether).
- You can acquire fake Ether for testing purposes by visiting the Infura faucet for the Sepolia network.
- Click on the following link to request fake Ether: [Infura Faucet - Sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia)

## Usage

Once the DApp is set up:

1.  **Connect your MetaMask wallet.**
2.  **Send crypto for chai.**
3.  **Pen a sweet message.**
4.  **Sip and savor your chai!** üçµ
