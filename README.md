# Buy Me a Chai üçµ

"Buy Me a Chai" is a decentralized platform reimagining how creators receive support, built on Web3 technology. Unlike traditional platforms like Buy Me a Coffee, our solution leverages blockchain to create a transparent, secure, and community-driven ecosystem where creators can showcase their work and receive cryptocurrency donations directly via Ethereum smart contracts.

- **Decentralized Donations**: With Ethereum-based transactions, there are no middlemen, ensuring that donations go directly to the creators.
- **Global Platform**: Anyone around the world can contribute without restrictions, thanks to blockchain technology.

## Installation

### Smart Contract Deployment

To get started with the "Buy Me a Chai" project, follow these steps

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buy-me-a-chai.git
cd buy-me-a-chai
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 3. Set up your Ethereum wallet & `.env`

Make sure you have Metamask installed in your browser to interact with the Ethereum network. You can download it [here](https://metamask.io/).

```
# Alchemy API URL for Sepolia
SEPOLIA_URL= your_alchemy_sepolia_url_here

# Alchemy API Key for Sepolia
SEPOLIA_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here

# Private Key for Ethereum Wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

- Create Account on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)

### 4. Deploy the smart contract

```
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/finalDeploy.js
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory

```
cd client
```

2. Install frontend dependencies & `.env`

```
npm install
```

```
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-contract-address
```

- **NOTE:- when you run this command you will gate your `contract-address`**

```
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/finalDeploy.js
```

3. Start the frontend server

```
npm start
```
